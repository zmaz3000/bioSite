                <h2 class="">About Bayley</h2>
                <p>Bayley is a wife and stay at home mother of 2 children. 
                    She is dedicated and determined in whatever it is she 
                    sets her mind to, often pursuing research and growth 
                    through reading and community to better herself and others. 
                    Bayley prefers to be around others and always seeks to be 
                    in a people filled environment with her Choleric/Sanguine personality. 
                    She enjoys thrift store shopping to find the best deal, crafting, reading, cooking, and interior design. 
                    Her favorite design style is Modern Organic, which brings elements of simple and natural styles together. 
                    Bayley has some interests in music and would really love to someday take a crash course in piano to be able 
                    to accompany herself singing. Of all of her hobbies, thrifting is probably her biggest passion. 
                    If she could, she would create a business out of this, to find the best deals and get them to others. 
                    She feels a sense of joy and energy when finding a great deal in a thrift store. 
                    Bayley graduated from Auburn University in 2019 with a Masterâ€™s degree in Speech Language pathology. 
                    One of her primary long term goals is to use this degree to  eventually create homeschool material for 
                    families that focuses on speech language therapy for children. Bayley is humble in her weaknesses and 
                    knows there are always ways that she can grow spiritually in her relationship with God. 
                    She prioritizes honesty, integrity and being straightforward, yet vulnerable in her friendships and is 
                    the person she is today because of this same level of honesty and integrity she holds in herself.
