                <p>Bayley is a very creative individual. She can come up with ideas on the spot and uses her natural ability to make crafts with her kids.
                    She also likes to experiment with different craft ideas from Pinterest and online. 
                    Some of her crafts can have great detail and design, while others can be as simple as characters on a popsicle stick.

                <p>Interior Design is a great passion of Bayley's. She often will rearrange a room a play around with different designs to see what might look best.
                    One design style that has stuck out to Bayley the most (and the primary one she uses in her home) is Modern Organic. 
                    According to Bayley, this is a style that brings in organic and natural tones with a simple design. Using her design skills also 
                    helps her to bring a creativity to flipping thrift store finds which is another hobby of hers.

                <h2 class="flex-header">Cooking</h2>
                <p>Originally, Bayley was not very interested in cooking. It was just something to get done so she could have food to eat. 
                    Within the last few years, she has leaned into cooking as an art form and tried new recipes while using the healthiest ingredients she can find. 
                    She often will make items from scratch, including sourdough bread which is out of this world! 
                    Now cooking has become a nice stress relief for her, where she can experiment and try new and fun things.

            <p>Thrifting is by far Bayley's favorite hobby. She can shop in a thrift store for hours! 
                Her ability to find the best deals and catch a quality or antique item out of the corner of her eye is unparalleled. 
                Bayley looks for all kinds of items while thrift shopping. One such item is furniture pieces, which her and her husband, Zach (such a cool guy) will refurbish and sell. 
                Bayley also has been able to find smaller, more collectors items to flip, as well as items to use for decorating within the Modern Organic style.
